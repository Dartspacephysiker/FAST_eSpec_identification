*HEY, if I have left a comment on the orbit, I have personally inspected it on SDT and know it is trash. Feel free to confirm for yourself, but don't bother asking me about it

*THE BLACKBALLS (on the basis of output from JOURNAL__20161124__POKE_AROUND_SOME_OF_THESE_DAYSIDE_ORBITS_WHERE_BROADBAND_FLUXES_ARE_CRAZY_HUGE)*
1031
1032 (Jee above 1.0e0 is clearly bogus)
1033 The whole orbit looks bad
1034 Very little worth salvaging
1038 Utter garbage
1039 Garbage
1042 Complete trash
1043 
1044 Beyond garbage

All right, I think I'm junking orbits 1031--1054

****A possible way to automate****

COND 1: Median of the log distribution of broadband energy fluxes lies above 

1a    : 0.5, discard the orbit (or at least the interval)
1b    : 0.0, mark as suspect

COND 2: Median of the log distribution of diffuse energy fluxes lies above 

2a    : 0.0, discard the orbit (or at least the interval)
2b    : -0.5, mark as suspect

If two suspect marks, discard the orbit
