*HEY, if I have left a comment on the orbit, I have personally inspected it on SDT and know it is trash. Feel free to confirm for yourself, but don't bother asking me about it

*THE BLACKBALLS (on the basis of output from JOURNAL__20161124__POKE_AROUND_SOME_OF_THESE_DAYSIDE_ORBITS_WHERE_BROADBAND_FLUXES_ARE_CRAZY_HUGE)*
1031
1032 (Jee above 1.0e0 is clearly bogus)
1033 The whole orbit looks bad
1034 Very little worth salvaging
1038 Utter garbage
1039 Garbage
1042 Complete trash
1043 
1044 Beyond garbage

All right, I think I'm junking orbits 1031--1054

****A possible way to automate****

COND 1: Median of the log distribution of broadband energy fluxes lies above 

1a    : 0.5, discard the orbit (or at least the interval)
1b    : 0.0, mark as suspect

COND 2: Median of the log distribution of diffuse energy fluxes lies above 

2a    : 0.0, discard the orbit (or at least the interval)
2b    : -0.5, mark as suspect

If two suspect marks, discard the orbit

*KILL EM*
1002 Utter, total garbage
1028 Makes me want to junk the first many many. They are problematique.
1055 Holy trash
3461 Like 7925, the signs of bogus
7822 Also pretty huge energy fluxes. Over 1000 mW/m2
7836 HUGE energy fluxes, like over 1000 mW/m2 (Some data is good, but do I want to pick through it? No way)
7891 Contamination of some kind. What is it?
7925 Looks like it could be salvaged, but it has many appearances of bogus


*REVISIT EM*
1028 Distribution is questionable
10527 wants to be addressed, but I'm not sure what to do
